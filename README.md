# An overview of DeFi, 0x Protocol, 0x API

This is a workshop that I initially gave  [U.C. Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/spring-2020-developers-decal/) (30/3/20), which was the re-purposed for [Defi Discussions](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/spring-2020-developers-decal/).

## More about the workshop

You are an app developer excited about ERC20 markets, and you found out that 0x API offers the best prices for trading DAI <> USDC. You want to build your own branded
exchange UI that uses the 0x API to easily swap between DAI and USDC.

## Goal of the workshop

During this workshop, we will:

- Quickly speak about important practical considerations of swapping ERC20 tokens:
  - Converting big integers to base unit numbers using `Web3Wrapper.toBaseUnitAmount()`, and vice-versa.
  - Allowing the ERC20 Exchange proxy to trade using your wallet funds
- Perform a Swap using the 0x API
  - Learn how to inspect a 0x API swap quote response
  - Learn how to perform with swap in 1 extra line of code!

## Environment setup

This demo will only work on the Kovan testnet.

This tutorial will be using 2 dummy ERC20 token contracts that I deployed on the Kovan testnet. These are not the real DAI and USDC, but they are drop-in replacements. Each contract also exposes a `mint(uint256)` function that can be used to create tokens for the user.

- DAI (18 decimals) is hosted at: `0x48178164eB4769BB919414Adc980b659a634703E`
- USDC (6 decimals) is hosted at: `0x5a719Cf3E02c17c876F6d294aDb5CB7C6eB47e2F`

## Environment setup

This webapp has been tested with Node v10.15.3. Use `npm install` to install all the various dependencies and, after installation finishes successfully, run `npm run serve` to run a live webserver on `http://localhost:9000`. Any chance to the TypeScript code will trigger the webpage to refresh with newly compiled code.
